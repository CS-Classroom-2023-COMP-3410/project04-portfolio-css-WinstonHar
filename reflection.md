Honestly before starting on this project I though it would be way harder to complete than it actually was. Mostly due to chatgpt though. For fun I decided to add in chatgpt prompts to show how it made the process basically non involved besides some fine tuning and tweaking to get the style just right to what I wanted. To complete the assignment I asked chatgpt that I wanted an external style sheet that matched all the instructeds pasted below. Then I pasted the assignment instructions and then pasted my code below that. It spit out an okay output but it had I few issues espically with readability.

In terms of design choice I decided to just keep what I had but put them into vertically stacked boxes justified in the center and justified against the background images I already had. The background images should be adjusted a bit so they don't get tiled but instead fill the page too. Then I made a top nav bar with hover buttons and that was pretty much it. In terms of colors I first went for a all blue style but it was too cold, then an all green but that also looked weird. So I settelled on a few complementary pastel colors that I found in a random photo and asked chatgpt to include those in the style.css sheet and adjusted them a bit for the final result. I am pretty happy with what I have! In terms of responsiveness those center boxes just center and shrink wrapping text around themselves, the nav bar just stacks when the width is too short as well.
