            <h2>Climbing Spots I've been to near Denver</h2>
            <p>As you might guess Denver is one of the main climbing hotspots in the USA. While there are plenty of indoor climbing gyms; Movement Gyms, DBC, the Spot, Übergrippen, etc, there are also many outdoor spots. Here are the ones I've been too;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shelf Road, Cañon City</li>
                    <p> A great place to camp overnight and go lead climbing on nearby dark and light walls. Tons of routes to lead or even trad climb. Check out mountain project for this spot I believe it's one of the most developed in Colorado for outdoor lead.</p>
                    <p> 38°37'45.3"N 105°13'41.0"W</p>
                <li>Dines Cliff, Pine Junction, Staunton State Park</li>
                    <p> This spot is similar to Shelf Road but way closer to Denver so it's more convienent to come over for a lead climbing day trip.</p>
                    <p> 39°30'12.2"N 105°22'09.7"W</p>
                <li>Gunella Pass, Georgetown</li>
                    <p> You can only boulder at this spot. Very nice in spring or before first snowfall. Not alot of parking near the boulders so make sure to go on a weekday if you want to make sure you don't have to walk super far.</p>
                    <p> 39°38'04.2"N 105°42'35.3"W</p>
                <li>Crown Rock, Boulder</li>
                    <p> To be honest this bouldering area is pretty terrible but it's super close to Denver and Boulder so it makes it a decent area to teach people how to boulder outdoors. </p>
                    <p> 40°00'04.1"N 105°17'49.0"W</p>
                <li>Crater Lake, Berthoud</li>
                    <p> This spot is pretty epic in the summer. Bouldering only. After hitting some rock you can hop in Crater Lake near the parking lot to cool off! </p>
                    <p> 40°18'59.8"N 105°12'42.7"W</p>

            <p>Two years ago the DU climbing officers were invited out to check out boulders in the Kenedy Mountain Campus. It was super cold but pretty fun to set a few routes.</font></mark></p>

            <p>One summer I went climbing with my father and older brother in Red Rocks near Las Vegas. It got super hot really early in the morning but the rocks were amazing.</font></mark></p>
